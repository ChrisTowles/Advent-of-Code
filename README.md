# Advent-of-Code

Personal repo for [Advent-of-Code](https://adventofcode.com)


## 2024

Last year I did it in dart, but I didn't push the repo and I only did a first 10 days or so. This year I'm just doing typescript as I'm coding in anything but python or typescript lately and not trying to learn any new current languages.
